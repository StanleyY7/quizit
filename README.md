### Welcome to QuizIt!

This side/hobby-project was made to assist people I know who host the occasional quiz for work/team-building activities and to also practice my existing skills. This SPA generates random quiz questions (for a variety of topics) and their answers (when the user clicks a button) by fetching data from The Trivia API and then displaying it onto a grid by mapping over the data.
